import React from "react"

/* uncontrolled component/input/form
Uncontrolled inputs are like traditional HTML form inputs:
They remember what you typed. You can then get their value using a ref.
Donâ€™t cause re-render component.
The input value is not being managed by React.

controller component/input/form
The value  is handled by the react state.
It is one that takes its current value through props and notifies changes through callbacks like onChange. A parent component "controls" it by handling the callback and managing its own state and passing the new values as props to the controlled component.
